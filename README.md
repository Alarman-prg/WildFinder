## Description (about 100 words)

> Our app will allow for individuals interested in hiking to find likeminded individuals for adventures on local trails.
Our motivation behind this application is to get people outdoors and meeting new people! Our goals include 
allowing users to make connections to other users, allow users to find experienced people of particular trails to increase confidence
incase of uneasiness in their ability to hike a more difficult trail, and to increase the amount of people utilizing public trails 
and spreading awareness of NC wildlife. Some features of our app will include a map of local trails to the piedmont area, a chatroom based off intrest
in a particular trail/park, and possibly wildlife information.
